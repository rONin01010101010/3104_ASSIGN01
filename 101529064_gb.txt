George Brown College is where I'm studying right now, and it's right in the heart of downtown Toronto. It's been around since 1967, so it's got a pretty solid reputation. What I like about GBC is that we don't just sit in lectures all day - there are tons of hands-on stuff and real projects. They've got three campuses (St. James, Casa Loma, and Waterfront) and offer like 170+ programs. The best part is they actually connect us with companies and industry people, so we're learning stuff that's actually useful in the real world, not just theory from textbooks.
