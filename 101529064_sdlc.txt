DevOps plays a critical role in modern software development lifecycles. Traditional development approaches often created silos between development and operations teams, leading to deployment issues and inefficiencies. DevOps addresses these challenges by fostering collaboration and implementing automation throughout the software delivery process. This methodology enables faster release cycles and earlier bug detection. Automation reduces manual processes and minimizes human error. DevOps skills have become essential requirements in the technology sector because this approach represents the current standard for software development and deployment.
