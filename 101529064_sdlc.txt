At first, I didn't really get why DevOps was such a big deal, but now I see it's actually super important for how software gets made today. Like, in the old days, developers would throw code over the wall to operations, and then things would break in production. DevOps fixes this by getting everyone working together and automating various tasks. We can push updates way faster and catch bugs earlier. Plus, all the automation means less manual work and fewer stupid mistakes. Honestly, after learning about this, I realize pretty much every tech job posting mentions DevOps skills for a reason - it's just how modern software development works now.
