So COMP 3104 is basically our DevOps course, and honestly, it's pretty intense but in a good way. We're learning all the tools that actual dev teams use - Git for version control, Docker for containers, Jenkins for automation, all that stuff. The professor has us doing these labs where we set up CI/CD pipelines and deploy applications, which is way more interesting than just memorizing concepts. We also cover GitHub Actions and Kubernetes, which I keep seeing in job postings. It's a lot to take in, but I can see why companies want people who know this stuff.
